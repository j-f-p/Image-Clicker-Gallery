# Image Clicker Album

## Description

This project was inspired by the Udacity course JavaScript Design Patterns. This project contains a browser app involving an album of five images. A list of image labels appear at the top of the page. When the user clicks on an image label, the image is displayed, along with the number of times the user has clicked on the image. The number of image clicks is accumulated, from the time the image URL is first referenced, and is unique to each image. In addition, when an image is displayed, an edit button appears below its frame. Clicking on the edit button, enables the user to change the image, by way of URL, and the name of the image. This page is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES 6). The script, developed from scratch, follows the Model-View-Controller software architectural pattern. This page was confirmed with three browsers: Chrome 70, Firefox 63 and Edge 42. Furthermore, it was confirmed for various standard device screen sizes using Chrome and Firefox device emulation tools (responsive design tools).

## Project Execution

To run the browser app, open `./index.html` with a recent version of Chrome, Firefox or Edge, such as those listed above.

# Cat Clicker

## Abstract

This is a page containing a list of five cats by name. When the user clicks on a name, a profile of that cat is displayed. Each profile contains a cat image and informs the user how many times the user has clicked on the cat image. This page is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES 6). The script follows the Model-View-Controller software architectural pattern. This page was confirmed with three browsers: Chrome 69, FireFox 62 and Edge 42.

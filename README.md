# Image Clicker Album

## Description

This is a page containing an album of five images. A list of image labels appear at the top of the page. When the user clicks on an image label, the image is displayed, along with the number of times the user has clicked on the image. The number of image clicks is accumulated from the time the image data was loaded and is unique to each image. In addition, when an image is displayed, an edit button appears below it. Clicking on the edit button, enables the user to change the image, by way of URL, and the name of the image. New image data is loaded when an image edit is made with a distinct name or a distinct URL. This page is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES 6). The script, developed from scratch, follows the Model-View-Controller software architectural pattern. This page was confirmed with three browsers: Chrome 70, Firefox 63 and Edge 42. Furthermore, it was confirmed for various standard device screen sizes using Chrome and Firefox device emulation tools (responsive design tools).
